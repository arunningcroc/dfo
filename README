OFDFT/DFT solver for one-dimensional systems.

You need gfortran (or some other Fortran compiler), LAPACK, BLAS and OpenMP.

Pull the code, and type

make test
./test

If tests are OK, then the program can be used.

I used this code for my MSC thesis to test simple 1D KE models, and so the code is something of a mess.
